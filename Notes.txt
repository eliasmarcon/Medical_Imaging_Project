## Histories 64x64
- higher resolution --> better test accuracy
- 

# To Do:
1. GAN architecture tests
2. If successful, train 1+1 on cluster
2b. Train Densenet on higher res images and 64 scaled and cropped images
3a. With trained models create pipeline for Densenet and evaluation
3b. Train GAN on remaining data

# Next testing steps/hypotheses
**Most likely, our architecture is not useful for our kind of images!**


## Test higher noise dimension
- Idea: test, whether the amount of noise values is responsible for the low variety in output images.
- cluster: run GAN 64x64 images and higher noise dim
- expected output: no change in variety, because other GANs have diverse output with less noise dim
--> NOT tested, because we saw in other architectures, that less was enough


## New GAN architecture
- Idea: our GAN is not made for high dimensions, therefore we may need to change the layer structure
-> test new GANs from online resources (kaggle)
- expected output: better/more diverse output images, especially for 64x64 images
