## Histories 64x64
- higher resolution --> better test accuracy
- 

# Next testing steps/hypotheses
## Test higher noise dimension
- Idea: test, whether the amount of noise values is responsible for the low variety in output images.
- cluster: run GAN 64x64 images and higher noise dim
- expected output: no change in variety, because other GANs have diverse output with less noise dim

## New GAN architecture
- Idea: our GAN is not made for high dimensions, therefore we may need to change the layer structure
-> test new GANs from online resources
- expected output: better/more diverse output images, especially for 64x64 images
