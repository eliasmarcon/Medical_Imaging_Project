## Histories 64x64
- higher resolution --> better test accuracy
- 

# To Do:
1. GAN architecture tests
2. If successful, train 1+1 on cluster
2b. Train Densenet on higher res images and 64 scaled and cropped images
3a. With trained models create pipeline for Densenet and evaluation
3b. Train GAN on remaining data
4a. Try to generate all benign types

# Next testing steps/hypotheses
**Most likely, our architecture is not useful for our kind of images!**
- Densenet on scaled images: downsampling is surprisingly no problem!
    --> Show the scores of

## Test higher noise dimension
- Idea: test, whether the amount of noise values is responsible for the low variety in output images.
- cluster: run GAN 64x64 images and higher noise dim
- expected output: no change in variety, because other GANs have diverse output with less noise dim
--> NOT tested, because we saw in other architectures, that less was enough


## New GAN architecture
- Idea: our GAN is not made for high dimensions, therefore we may need to change the layer structure
-> test new GANs from online resources (kaggle)
- expected output: better/more diverse output images, especially for 64x64 images


# Paper / Report Notes
- Densenet trained on 40X, 100X, 200X, 400X with each 64x64, 128x128 and 256x256
- It seems that resizing to 64x64 pixel does not produce any noticeable deterioration in test accuracy.
    - 40X
        - 64x64     - 0.88
        - 256x256   - 0.89
    - 100X
        - 64x64     - 0.83
        - 256x256   - 0.86
    - 200X
        - 64x64     - 0.84
        - 256x256   - 0.84
    - 400X 
        - 64x64     - 0.84
        - 256x256   - 0.80

- Accuracy deteriorates by a maximum of 3% in some cases and even improves by 4% in the case of 400X.
